# forkify-app

//Description
This is my second JavaScript Project, that I have worked on. 

//Dependencies used
An MVC architecture was used here in a form of ES6 modules.
"webpack" was used to bundle the modules into a package that is ready to be deployed.
"Babel" is used to convert the ES6 code to ES5 to enable compatibility with older browsers.

//How the app works
It connects to Food2Fork API and fetches food recipes.
These recipes are then formatted and displayed to the user with some built-in functions to increase the servings.
Furthermore It is possible to save the recipe to favorites, this way the recipe can be loaded without searching for it.
