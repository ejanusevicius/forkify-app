# forkify-app

//Description<br>
This is my second JavaScript Project, that I have worked on.

//Dependencies used<br>
An <b>MVC</b> architecture was used here in a form of ES6 modules.<br>
<b>"webpack"</b> was used to bundle the modules into a package that is ready to be deployed.<br>
<b>"Babel"</b> is used to convert the ES6 code to ES5 to enable compatibility with older browsers.<br>

//How the app works<br>
It connects to Food2Fork API and fetches food recipes.<br>
These recipes are then formatted and displayed to the user with some built-in functions to increase the servings.<br>
Furthermore It is possible to save the recipe to favorites, this way the recipe can be loaded without searching for it.<br>
